Feature: REST API Examples
    The following examples show the features of this testing application
    and available options for data

    Scenario: Making a simple GET request
        When I make a GET request to "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"
        # Then The response property "userId" should be "1"
        # And The response property "id" should be "1"

    # Scenario: Making a simple DELETE request
    #     When I make a DELETE request to "/posts/1"
    #     Then The response status code should be "200"

    # Scenario: Making a POST request with json data
    #     Given The json request data
    #         """json
    #         {
    #         "title": "foo",
    #         "body": "bar",
    #         "userId": 1
    #         }
    #         """
    #     When I make a POST request to "/posts"
    #     Then The response property "userId" should be "1"
    #     And The response property "id" should be "101"

    # Scenario: Making a POST request using tabular data (same as above, but alternate format)
    #     Given The request data
    #         | title | body | userId |
    #         | foo   | bar  | 1      |
    #     When I make a POST request to "/posts"
    #     Then The response property "userId" should be "1"
    #     And The response property "id" should be "101"

    # Scenario: Making a POST request using phrases (same as above, but alternate format)
    #     Given the property "title" is set to "foo"
    #     And the property "body" is set to "bar"
    #     And the property "userId" is set to "1"
    #     When I make a POST request to "/posts"
    #     Then The response property "userId" should be "1"
    #     And The response property "id" should be "101"

    # Scenario Outline: Using examples to run multiple tests
    #     Given the property "title" is set to "<title>"
    #     And the property "body" is set to "<body>"
    #     And the property "userId" is set to "<userid>"
    #     When I make a POST request to "/posts"
    #     Then The response property "userId" should be "<userid>"

    #     Examples:
    #         | title | body | userId |
    #         | foo   | bar  | 1      |
    #         | fooz  | barz | 1      |
